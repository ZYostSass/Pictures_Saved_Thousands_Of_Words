## Things to note

- This project uses sqlx-cli and cargo-commander, both of which can be 
installed via cargo install.

- Commander is used for seeding/migration management, similar to npm scripts

-- need to install sqlx-cli from source to get latest updates for making this 
work without timestamped seeds `cargo install sqlx-cli --git https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx.git --force `
